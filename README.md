## 🌱 About Me

Hi, I'm **Arden** — a developer who treats code as both a craft and a curiosity.  
I love exploring bugs like puzzles, building little things for fun, and reflecting as I go.

This is my space.  
This is my pace.  
Welcome in.

## 🧠 What I'm into these days

- 🛠️ **Side quests**: mini projects, experiments, and creative ideas
- 🐞 **Break & Fix**: logs from strange bugs and how I fixed them
- 💭 **Thoughts**: dev musings, perspectives, and philosophy
- 🧩 **Bite-size**: tiny learnings I collect along the way
