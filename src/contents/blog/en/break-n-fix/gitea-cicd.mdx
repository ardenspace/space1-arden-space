## CI/CD with Gitea Actions: Automated Web Deployment Using Nginx and Docker

If you Google CI/CD, it says it stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Put simply, it means automatically integrating and deploying code that gets updated on a regular basis.

<br />
As the number of websites we manage at work kept growing, I really started to feel
the need for deployment automation. Back in late spring this year, I told the team
I wanted to give CI/CD a try. Their response was basically, “Sure, but only when
things aren’t too busy.”

The problem is… things are never not busy. There’s always something going on at the company, and after work I’m tied up with side projects. So I never even got the chance to try.

But recently, with a new frontend team lead joining us, I finally got the opportunity to dive into CI/CD.

- The old way ❓

Previously, I’d work locally, then our lead would review the changes, build them, and manually drop the static files onto the server. Honestly, I really wanted to get away from this setup, but since it meant touching the server, I kept putting it off.

As a stopgap, I switched things over to a setup where the server was connected to Git, and we’d just build directly on the server.

A few days after hooking up Git, though, my team lead came by and said he’d set up a deployment environment — and suggested we integrate CI/CD into one of the sites I’m currently managing.

  <li>1. Gitea</li>
  <li>2. Docker</li>
  <li>3. Nginx</li>
</ol>
<br />
Inside the company, we use **Gitea**. And since Gitea also comes with a CI/CD
feature called **Gitea Actions**, we decided to take advantage of it.

To make sure the pages built in Gitea run the same way in any environment, we went with Docker. Finally, the Docker container gets hooked up to our in-house web server, Nginx, so that external users can access it.

## Understanding the Role of Gitea Actions

First, let’s take a look at what exactly Gitea Actions does.

(The diagram was made using the Mermaid Live Editor.)

In short, Gitea Actions goes through the steps of:
[docker install > npm package install > build a new docker compose > deploy to the server].

Since this process basically makes up the entire CI/CD flow, having a clear picture beforehand helps a lot when writing code — you’re less likely to get lost. I didn’t know that at first and just dove in headfirst… which meant I ended up fumbling around quite a bit. 😅

<br />

## Running Docker Locally

For some reason, I was in such a rush that I didn’t even bother testing things locally — I just went straight to pushing Docker files into Gitea. All because I was eager to mess around with the Nginx config... lol. Obviously, that only led to me stumbling around.

Seeing this, my team lead told me to try it locally first, and once it works, then push it up. So that’s what I did. Slow and steady. Slow and steady!
