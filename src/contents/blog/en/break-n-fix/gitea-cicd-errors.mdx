As I mentioned at the end of my last post, here’s a quick recap of the errors I ran into while setting up CI/CD.

<div className="bar" />

## 🧭 When every path except "/" returns a 404 error

I worked on two pages—one built with React and the other with Next.js. The React app had a routing issue: changing the path always resulted in an Nginx 404 error.

The fix was simpler than expected.

- Solution

Add a SPA fallback in the `location` block of your Nginx config.

<CodeBlock>
```
location / {
    ...
    # SPA fallback
    proxy_intercept_errors on;
    error_page 404 = /index.html;
    # Serve index.html when the server thinks the path doesn't exist
}
```
</CodeBlock>

You don’t need this fallback for a Next.js app. Why is that?

<br />

React apps are SPAs (Single Page Applications), so routing is handled on the client. All static assets are served up front, and subsequent page requests only fetch the data needed for updates. Because of this, when a different URL is requested, the server assumes the path doesn’t exist—hence the Nginx 404. You need a fallback.

<br />
What about Next.js? It’s an SSR (Server Side Rendering) framework, where the server
handles routing and renders the requested path. So no separate fallback is needed.
If you do see a 404, you likely requested a page that truly doesn’t exist.

## 🍚 GPG error: http://deb.debian.org/debian bullseye InRelease: At least one invalid signature was encountered.

This error occurred while installing Docker in Gitea Actions. Everything worked fine just moments before, then suddenly this error started causing Docker builds to fail. GPT suggested it was a Debian verification issue, which didn’t seem quite right—so I Googled it and found others with the same problem.

Docker system disk space issue?

- Solution

<CodeBlock>
```

// Check disk usage
df -h

// Check disk usage of the partition containing /var/lib/docker
sudo df -h /var/lib/docker

```
</CodeBlock>

😅😅 … Disk usage was a whopping … 100% … full! 😅😅

<CodeBlock>
```

// Remove stopped containers
docker container prune -f
// Remove unused images
docker image prune -af
// Remove unused volumes
docker volume prune -f
// Remove unused networks
docker network prune -f

```
</CodeBlock>

Issue resolved 😄😄😄

## 🔓 node:20-alpine: failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/node:20-alpine:...

<CodeBlock>
```

// Full error
failed to solve: node:20-alpine: failed to resolve source metadata for docker.io/library/node:20-alpine: unexpected status from HEAD request to https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/node/manifests/20-alpine: 401 Unauthorized

```
</CodeBlock>

This one seems to happen fairly often too. A quick search shows it discussed on the Docker forum.

- Solution

<CodeBlock>

docker logout
docker login

```
</CodeBlock>

Once your CI/CD environment is up and running, life gets so much easier. Next up, I’ll be integrating CI/CD into a mobile app — can’t wait to learn more and share it here!
