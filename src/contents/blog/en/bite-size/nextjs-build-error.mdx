## Error: Vulnerable version of Next.js detected

I was just minding my own business, trying to build my Next.js project after writing a blog post, when a red error suddenly popped up and killed the build. <br />

Wait, what happened? 😦😬
<br />
[📎Vercel KB - React2Shell Bulletin](https://vercel.com/kb/bulletin/react2shell)

/>

<br />
To sum it up, a security vulnerability called **React2Shell** was discovered.

<CodeBlock>
```
- Using Next.js 15.0.0 ~ 16.0.6
- Using Next.js 14 canary (v14.3.0-canary.76 or later)
- Using any framework that utilizes React Server Components (RSC)
```
</CodeBlock>

The bulletin strongly recommends upgrading if your project falls under any of the above. <br />It looks like Vercel is proactively blocking builds because this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) or even source code leaks. Honestly, a good move on their part.

<br />

### The Fix❓
<br />
The solution is actually very simple.

<CodeBlock>
pnpm update next@latest
</CodeBlock>

At work, we handled this immediately as soon as the vulnerability was announced, but I guess I was a bit negligent with my personal project...
<br />Lesson learned.
