## Project Purpose

After two years as a developer, I‚Äôve started to understand things more deeply. I figured that if I can express what I‚Äôve learned, I might be able to understand it even better. So, I decided to build a personal blog to help me grow.

<div className="bar" />

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, MDX <br />
**Version Control**: Git, GitHub

<div className="bar" />

## Considerations

<ol>
  <li>1. Using a combination of Next.js, TypeScript, and Markdown</li>
  <li>2. Supporting both Korean and English</li>
  <li>3. Adding plenty of personal flair to the design</li>
</ol>

- Using a combination of Next.js, TypeScript, and Markdown

<div>
  I was worried that setting up a server for the blog might be too overwhelming
  and make me lose motivation, so I decided to go with MDX instead. It turned
  out to be a great call ‚Äî using MDX actually made Next.js feel much more
  familiar. I hadn‚Äôt really worked with TypeScript much outside of personal
  projects, so I applied it here to get a better feel for it. It‚Äôs practical and
  helps keep the code clean, so even though it can be challenging, I find myself
  coming back to it again and again.
</div>

- Supporting both Korean and English

<div>
  While I hope to work overseas one day, I also took on this challenge to become
  more familiar with official documentation, which is mostly in English.
</div>

- Adding plenty of personal flair to the design

<div>
  I plan to use this blog as part of my portfolio, so I wanted to add a touch of
  fun from a frontend developer‚Äôs perspective. It‚Äôs packed with my personal
  style, and whenever my taste changes or I want to try new designs, I‚Äôll update
  it accordingly.
</div>

<div className="bar" />

### Using a combination of Next.js, TypeScript, and Markdown

- Start a project

<div></div>
<CodeBlock>npx create-next-app --typescript Your Project Name</CodeBlock>

Before the project is created, it asks a few questions:

<br />
<ol>
  <li>1. Would you like to use TypeScript? Yes</li>
  <li>2. Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? Yes</li>
  <li>3. Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? Yes</li>
</ol>
<br />
With that, getting Next.js + TypeScript set up is already a success.

- Connecting Markdown

There were some twists and turns. At first, I finished development using the popular _Contentlayer_, but when I started working on the design, I found out that the package was no longer supported by the community.
On top of that, Next.js actually has a built-in MDX solution ‚Äî **@next/mdx**.
Let‚Äôs go for it!

<br />
<br />
a. Download the package

<CodeBlock>
  pnpm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
  next-mdx-remote
</CodeBlock>

b. Modify _next.config.ts_ (create it in the src folder if it doesn‚Äôt exist)

<CodeBlock>
```
import createMDX from "@next/mdx";

const nextConfig = {
pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"],
transpilePackages: ["next-mdx-remote"],
};

const withMDX = createMDX({
// Add markdown plugins here, as desired
});

export default withMDX(nextConfig);
```
</CodeBlock>

c. Modify _mdx-components.tsx_ (create it in the src folder if it doesn‚Äôt exist)

<CodeBlock>
```
import type { MDXComponents } from "mdx/types";

export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return {
    ...components,
  };
}
```
</CodeBlock>

Let‚Äôs start by connecting the metadata, since the goal for now is to link MDX files. <br />
d. Fetching Metadata <br />
File path: _src\lib\posts.ts_

<CodeBlock>
```
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import matter from "gray-matter";

// Blog post data type
export type PostMeta = {
title: string;
description: string;
date: string;
thumbnail: string;
category: string;
slug: string; // slug? just means the filename.
locale: string;
};

// File path to fetch metadata from
const contentDir = path.join(process.cwd(), "src/contents");

// Function to fetch metadata
export function getMetaData(locale: string): PostMeta[] {

// To support Korean and English, the posts folder is divided into `en` and `ko`.
// The language is passed as an argument to `getMetaData` to fetch posts accordingly.
const localeDir = path.join(contentDir, locale);

if (!fs.existsSync(localeDir)) return [];

// Since categories play an important role in the blog, I separated them before passing data to the client.
const categories = fs.readdirSync(localeDir);

return categories.flatMap((category) => {
const categoryDir = path.join(localeDir, category);
const files = fs
.readdirSync(categoryDir)
.filter((file) => file.endsWith(".mdx"));

return files.map((file) => {
const slug = file.replace(/\.mdx$/, "");
const filePath = path.join(categoryDir, file);
const source = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf8");
const { data } = matter(source);

      return {
        ...(data as Omit<PostMeta, "category" | "slug" | "locale">),
        locale,
        category,
        slug,
      };
    });

});
}

```
</CodeBlock>

e. Displaying Metadata <br />
File path: src\app\[locale]\blog\page.tsx

<CodeBlock>
```

import { getMetaData } from "@/lib/posts";
import ClientBlogPage from "./ClientBlogPage"; // This is the client-side component that renders the blog post list.
Think of it as a page where you can get a quick overview of all the posts.

export default async function BlogPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ locale: string }>;
}) {
  const { locale } = await params;
  const postsMetaData = getMetaData(locale);

// Grouping posts by category
const categorized = postsMetaData.reduce((acc, post) => {
if (!acc[post.category]) acc[post.category] = [];
acc[post.category].push(post);
return acc;
}, {} as Record<string, typeof postsMetaData>);

const categories = Object.keys(categorized);
const selectedCategory = categories[0] || "";

return (

<ClientBlogPage
  categories={categories}
  categorizedPosts={categorized}
  initialCategory={selectedCategory}
/>
); }

```
</CodeBlock>

f. Connecting types on the client page

<CodeBlock>
```

export interface Post {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  slug: string;
  date: string;
  thumbnail: string;
  locale: string;
}

export interface PostProps {
  categories: string[];
  categorizedPosts: Record<string, Post[]>;
  initialCategory: string;
}

const ClientBlogPage = ({
categories,
categorizedPosts,
initialCategory,
}: PostProps) => {
...
}

```
</CodeBlock>

g. blah-blah.mdx?

...blah blah...

```
</CodeBlock>

MDX integration complete!

<br />
<br />

At first, I thought this would be a quick task, but it took longer than expected. <br />
But I DID IT! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÑ

<br />
I‚Äôll cover how to support both Korean and English, and how to link to individual post pages next time!
